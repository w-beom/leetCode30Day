 https://leetcode.com/ 에서 코로나로 인해 나가지 못하는 방구석 개발자들을 위해 30일 코딩 챌린지를 오픈했습니다.
 
 앞으로 30일동안 꾸준히 문제를 풀어서 올려보려 합니다. 
 
 피드백 부탁드립니다.

<pre>
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
</pre>

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1
</pre>

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Follow up:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
<pre>
Example:
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
</pre>
Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
